'''
For this assignment, you are going to play around with this boiler-plate code from 
Eder Santana, an AI research scientist at University of Florida.
http://edersantana.github.io

This is a very very basic example of RL.

Here is a nice overview of the project so you can get your bearings:
http://edersantana.github.io/articles/keras_rl/

You will need to fill in the experience replay class. This aspect of reinforcement learning
is CRUCIAL. Before scientists started implementing Exp replay, RL was a lost cause. This is 
the key-stone piece of this deep-learning algorithm.

The full code is on Eder's github account, but I encourage you to not sneak a peek at it 
until the end.
